A **Service Account** in Kubernetes is a special type of identity used by **non-human processes**, like Pods or controllers, to interact securely with the Kubernetes API.

---

## üîê What Is a Service Account?

Think of it as a **digital passport** for workloads inside your cluster. While human users authenticate via external systems (like OIDC or LDAP), **Pods use Service Accounts** to:

- Authenticate to the Kubernetes API
- Access secrets, config maps, or other resources
- Perform actions based on assigned roles (via RBAC)

---

## üß± Key Features

- **Namespaced**: Each ServiceAccount belongs to a specific namespace.
- **Auto-assigned**: If you don‚Äôt specify one, Kubernetes assigns the default ServiceAccount in that namespace.
- **Token-based**: Kubernetes mounts a short-lived JWT token into the Pod, allowing it to authenticate.
- **RBAC Integration**: You can bind Roles or ClusterRoles to a ServiceAccount to control what it can do.

## üõ† Example: Creating and Using a Service Account

### 1. **Create a ServiceAccount**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-app-sa
  namespace: default
```

### 2. **Assign It to a Pod**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-app-sa
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: my-image
```

### 3. **Grant Permissions with RBAC**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-app-sa
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## üß† Why It Matters

Service Accounts are essential for:
- **Secure automation** (e.g., CI/CD pipelines)
- **Fine-grained access control**
- **Integrating external systems** (e.g., Vault, Prometheus)

You can explore more in the [official Kubernetes docs on Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/).
